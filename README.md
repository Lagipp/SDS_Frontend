# SDS_Frontend

This is the final project for the LUT University course 'Anytime-course: Software Development Skills: Front-End'.
The task was to build a responsive website using HTML, SCSS and some minimal Javascript.

This repository contains the required coursework files, learning diary, project files, readme and video showcasing the finished product.

### Hosted Website: 

The finished website is hosted at https://lagipp.github.io/SDS_Frontend/. Click the link or type it manually in to your address bar.

You can also self-host the website if you want to by copying the repository to your local machine and running the `npm run sass` command in your terminal.
The site should start up in `localhost:5500` on your web browser.
